noticed when running the game that if we release the attack button mid-animation while the hitbox for the pickaxe is not disabled we'll walk around with an active hitbox
- added check in _physics_process if the "attack" action was just released. set the hitbox collisionshape disabled to true 

[x] picking up items
   [x] on player collides with item collision shape
      [x] signal on_body_entered
         [x] call function to add item to inventory
         [x] queue_free()

Trying to add multiple minable types to map. Current Minable Spawner, Minable, and Mined are not easily extensible
